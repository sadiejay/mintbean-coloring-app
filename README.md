## Overview
A painting app that was built with digital artists in mind using HTML, SCSS, JS. 

### The challenge
To build an app that let users express their creativity in a visual format. Users can drag their mouse across the screen to make free-form lines. Also, they can toggle between dark mode or light mode.


## Our process
Our goals for this project was to create a relaxing coloring app for the user who want to decompress or for the user who just want to create art. Our designer, researched the latest paint apps and wanted to create a relaxing  landing page that users would  gravitate to try Colurs. Designer created two wire frames and handed them off to the Developers. The Developers started working on creating the paint app. Fixing any bugs, or issues during that process. Once the bugs and issues were finished the Developers started styling landing page and painting app.
