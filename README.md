## Overview
A painting app that was built with digital artists in mind using HTML, SCSS, JS. Designs by Araevia Jones .

### The challenge

To build an app that let users express their creativity in a visual format. Users can drag their mouse across the screen to make free-form lines. Also, they can toggle between dark mode or light mode.


### Screenshot

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

## Our process
