### Our process
Our goals for this project was to create a relaxing coloring app for the user who want to decompress or for the user who just want to create art. Our website designer, researched the latest paint apps and wanted to create a relaxing landing page that users would gravitate to try Colurs. Website designer created two wire frames and handed them off to the Developers. 

Compiling different codepens and HTML5 canvas snippets, our App Interface Designer created 9 wireframes with feature and layout options. After discussing with the team, the team moved forward with a couple optons in mind. 

The Developers started working on creating the paint app. Fixing any bugs, or issues during that process. Once the bugs and issues were finished the Developers started styling landing page and painting app.
