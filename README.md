### Our process
Our goals for this project was to create a relaxing coloring app for the user who want to decompress or for the user who just want to create art. Our designer, researched the latest paint apps and wanted to create a relaxing  landing page that users would  gravitate to try Colurs. Designer created two wire frames and handed them off to the Developers. The Developers started working on creating the paint app. Fixing any bugs, or issues during that process. Once the bugs and issues were finished the Developers started styling landing page and painting app.
